[You volunteer to be the first human to test time travel, only going an hour forward in time. When you leave the travel pod, however, all humans on earth are gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2nm2k9/wp_you_volunteer_to_be_the_first_human_to_test/)
Pain, nausea, confusion, even pleasure - it was as if every sensation he had ever experienced all surged at once. His head was spinning. His insides were on fire. His stomach spasmed and, moments later, the contents of it came out onto the floor. With a quivering arm, he wiped the sweat from his brow, and then the vomit from the corners of his mouth.

Exhaustion.

Physical. Mental. He always wonder if all the preparation (perhaps torture was more apt) would prepare him for the task; it didn’t. He struggled to keep conscious, yet his mind and body gave into the welcoming darkness.

Peace at last.

His eyes shot open. His lungs screamed for air as he gasped. He felt relief with each gulp of oxygen. His head still throbbed, but his mind was clearing. He didn’t know how long he was out, but the involuntary sleep seemed to help his body acclimate. It must have been only a few seconds.

He undid the restraints, and reached into his pocket to grab a folded up piece of paper. He closed his eyes and drew upon his memory to recite a set of rehearsed facts. Things like his name, his wife, his son, and his birthday were among the script. Perhaps most importantly, he recited every word of the mission statement. Legacy and glory awaited him, but that wasn’t why he volunteered. At least, those weren’t the only reasons.

His motives were more selfish. Against his family’s wishes, he couldn’t pass up this opportunity. It was something he’d dreamed about since boyhood. He was eager to enroll in the program, and honored to be the first one chosen.

His fingers still tingled and felt foreign as he struggled to unfold the document. His eyes glanced over each word, confirming his memory was intact. He glanced at his vomit-stained wrist to read the time on the watch. It must have been busted due to the electromagnetism, even though the engineers ensured him that it was shielded to prevent that from happening. It was strange though. In all the previous non-human trials, the time was never off - especially by the magnitude of hours.

He checked the clock mounted on the instrument panel. It reported the same time. He rationalized that the devices just didn’t survive the trip - something he would have to note to the engineers. Though, he couldn’t blame them. Something like this was unprecedented. They were building technology on the cutting edge. And after all, what had worked in previous tests could hardly be expected to work in all future ones.

He was only supposed to be gone for an hour. Maybe he was unconscious for longer than he originally thought. But then, why had no one checked on him by now? He took a couple deep breaths. His military training kept his anxiety and panic at bay.

One thing at a time. The door.

His hands started to feel like his own again as he clenched and unclenched a fist. While he was by no means an idiot, he was thankful that the engineers had the foresight to make the pod door idiot-proof. It was a big red button under a Molly Guard that read “EXIT” in bold, black letters. With a flip and a push, the door unlatched and the airlock hissed as it unlocked. He could see light seeping through the outline of the door.

Rising from the seat, he leaned against the door, using his weight to push it open. The lab was normally brightly lit, but this was outright blinding. His corneas burned as they attempted to adjust. He fell to his knees, using one hand to prop himself up and the other to shield his eyes from the intense light.

Then he noticed it. First, it was the heat. The lab was typically kept at a cool, homeostatic 68 degrees Fahrenheit. He instantly felt delirious from the beating sun. And then the ground... His hand wasn’t resting against a hygienic, white tiled floor. It was dirt. And dust. And rocks.

Using the pod as a crutch, he rose to one knee. Still blinded and confused, it took all his strength to pull himself to his feet. He squinted and surveyed his surroundings. Stunned, he directed his attention back to the vehicle from which he had just climbed out. This was supposed to be a time machine, not a fucking spaceship.

Panic began to set in as he gazed back out on the horizon of the vast, endless desert.

“...Where the hell am I...?”
