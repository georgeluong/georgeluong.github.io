The NBA Players Association met with NBA executives and team owners on September 30th in an attempt to resolve the ongoing labor talks. With the opening night of the season quickly approaching, both sides of the disputes are now exhibiting a “sense of urgency.” Even the NBA’s marquee players, namely LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Kevin Durant, and Carmelo Anthony, were in attendance.

The All-Star cast has been criticized for not being as involved in the earlier discussions. Rather than letting the lesser stars fight the battles, they should be in the trenches with them. Dwyane Wade definitely made his presence known. Wade felt disrespected when he believed the commissioner singled him out during the meeting. ESPN reports:

> September 30th, 2011
>
> The players met separately for two hours before meeting with the owners.
> 
> While meeting with the owners, [David] Stern pointed at [Dwyane] Wade while making a comment, a source told [Chris] Broussard. Wade felt as if Stern was belittling him and yelled at the commissioner.
> 
> “You’re not pointing your finger at me,” Wade said, sources told ESPN The Magazine’s Ric Bucher. “I’m not your child.”
> 
> The sides then went their separate ways for a cooling-off session, but several of the players had heard enough. Sources said Stern then asked to speak separately with [Billy] Hunter, who then returned to speak with the players and was able to convince them to rejoin the owners in the meeting.

Luckily, cooler heads prevailed. Billy Hunter saved the day. If the players walked out of the meeting, I’m sure the owners would feel disrespected and, perhaps more damaging, lose faith in David Stern’s ability to mediate the conflict. Broussard mentioned that Stern’s comment was referring to all players, and Wade defended his ilk. Now, the tumultuous moment has become a rallying point for NBA players.

There is also a meeting today, October 1st. However, the marquee players will not be on the roll because they’re attending Chris Paul’s charity game …which makes me wonder if they just stopped by the meeting since they were in town.

There is still time to save the November 1st start to the season. Let’s just hope it isn’t squandered.
