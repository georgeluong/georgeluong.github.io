[Chris Broussard](https://twitter.com/Chris_Broussard/status/145156200416288769) of ESPN: The Magazine reports that Brandon Roy is set to retire from basketball as early as today due to a degenerative knee condition.

This is truly saddening news. When we hear a player announce his retirement, we hope that it is after a long, fulfilling career. Brandon Roy should be entering his prime at the ripe age of 27. When healthy, Roy was a perennial All-Star. Now, he’s going to hang up his jersey in what would have been only his sixth season in the league.

Drafted in 2006, Roy gave Portland fans hope that he would evolve into their superstar. For a couple seasons (2007-2009), he was a top-tier shooting guard, providing the Trail Blazers with the firepower to match Miami’s Dwyane Wade, and the Lakers’s Kobe Bryant. After the Portland Trail Blazers selected Greg Oden with the number one pick in the 2008 NBA Draft, it seemed as though the Trail Blazers was primed to become a Western Conference powerhouse.

Unfortunately, Roy was dealt a body that could not withstand the rigors of the NBA. Riding the pine for most of the Blazers’s 2010-2011 campaign, you could see the frustration on Roy’s face as he could only watch his team compete in the cutthroat Western Conference. After a couple injury-plagued seasons, Roy has decided to call it quits and begin the next chapter of his life.

As former players always say, “when you know it’s time, you know.” Hopefully, Brandon Roy will find a new career to fill the void of the hardwood and hoops. Perhaps he will join the panel of analysts on TNT, ESPN, or NBA TV. Or maybe it would be far too difficult for him to sit and watch his peers compete without him, his former team catalogue him in the annals of Blazers lore, or Portland fans chant another’s name.

Regardless of what Roy decides to do, I wish him the best of luck and good health.

And I leave you with video to remind us why Brandon Roy was a hero in Portland.
