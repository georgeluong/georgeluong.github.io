This article is quite late, but here are some highlights of the new NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).

For those who don’t know, the CBA is a contract between team owners and their players. It dictates the salary cap, player contract lengths, payroll, income distribution, etc. In six years (the length of the contract is actually 10 years), either side of the dispute may choose to extricate itself from the agreement. Thus, we may be facing another lockout in 2017…

## Basketball Related Income (BRI)

The main point the team owners and the NBA Players Union could not agree upon was how to split the pie. In the previous CBA, players received 57% of the estimated 3.82 billion dollar industry. Owners, who have been losing money each season, wanted the players to take a pay cut and lower their claim of BRI to 47%. After many meetings and arguments, the final split was reached at 50/50… and the players are not happy.

In the 2010-2011 season, the NBA recorded its best ratings in the post-Michael-Jordan era. If that’s the case, why are owners losing money? While there may be multiple factors, the most glaring problem is that owners are overspending on mediocre players.

Is that the fault of the players? Naturally, players strive to earn as much money as possible. If owners choose to overvalue an average journeyman, why should they punish players for that decision? Yes, the NBA players market has become a bidding war. Teams must dig deep into their pockets in order to lure that star player to stay relevant in an increasingly less competitive league. However, that is a fundamental flaw in the system itself. Shaquille O’Neal echoed the thoughts of many when he said “team owners need protection from themselves.”

Former players (legends in particular), have brought up the valid point that players are the ones filling the arenas. They are ones who step onto the hardwood and compete. And how does one truly quantify the value of superstars like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, or Dwight Howard? At $16 million a year, analysts unanimously agree that LeBron James is considerably underpaid. Whether you love him or hate him, James sells tickets.

Guess what happens when a marquee player leaves a small market team? Not surprisingly, the franchise loses money. A lot of it. Guess what happens when there’s a change in ownership for any NBA team? Who cares?Some fans probably don’t even know who owns their local team.

## Punitive Luxury Tax

In the previous CBA, teams had to budget their team to stay under the salary cap or otherwise pay a luxury tax of $1 for every $1 over the tax threshold. Needless to say, most teams try to be as frugal as possible. In fact, only seven teams had to pay taxes last year: Magic, Lakers, Mavericks, Celtics, Jazz, Blazers, and Rockets.

In the current CBA, the NBA wants to restore what it calls “competitive balance.” Competitive balance is the league’s method to prevent the big market teams from having an unfair advantage over the small market teams. Now, if a team goes over the tax threshold, they pay a steeper tax according to the level of the infraction.

|           Over          |             Tax             |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| $0-$5 million           | $1.50 for every dollar over |
| $5 million-$10 million  | $1.75 for every dollar over |
| $10 million-$15 million | $2.50 for every dollar over |
| $15 million-$20 million | $3.25 for every dollar over |
{: .table}

Does this new luxury tax help improve competitive balance? Yes, to an extent. However, I don’t believe its impact will be great. Only seven out of thirty teams had to pay the tax last year. No one likes spending more money than required. Even without the new tax, I think owners will continue to pinch their purses.

## Extend-and-Trade

Extend-and-trades work similarly to sign-and-trades, except teams don’t have to wait until their players become free agents before using it. Not a huge change, but it seems like they wrote this in because of the Carmelo Anthony to New York situation. We’ll probably see New Orleans and Orlando using this for Chris Paul and Dwight Howard, respectively.

## Minimum Team Salary

Minimum team salary has been increased from 75% of salary cap to 85% of salary cap. How does this impact teams? Well, it will impact a team’s ability to use its…

## Amnesty

When I first heard about this clause, I thought it would revolutionize the league. I was wrong.

Once in a while, a player will perform deceivingly well. They’ll put up 28.4 PPG, 6.0 APG, and 4.6 RPG. That’s a very good statistical year. That was the stat line of Gilbert Arenas in 2006-2007. Hibachi (as his fans adoringly referred to him) used to be a superstar of the league; embroiled in exciting shootouts against Kobe Bryant, routinely posting up 40+ point games, and hitting classic buzzer-beaters to steal a game.

However, during the 2007-2008 season, Agent Zero (another one of his monikers) sustained a knee injury, suiting up for only thirteen games. Arenas reached the end of his contract, and the Washington Wizards jumped at the chance to resign their franchise player, disregarding his bum knee. Arenas signed a staggering contract of $111 million over six years with the Wizards.

Sadly, Gilbert was never the same player he was before the injury. He suffered multiple injury-riddled seasons, and even got into [legal trouble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbfJz4gCdwA). Suddenly, the Wizards were stuck with a $18 million/year benchwarmer. He sucked up their salary cap, and no team wanted to take on his massive contract, killing trade opportunities.

Amnesty allows NBA teams to expunge one contract from their books during the life of the current CBA. Teams would still have to pay the players the contract, however the contract will not count against the salary cap or the tax threshold. This allows teams that have given or taken bad contracts a do-over.

I thought several teams would jump at the opportunity to dump bad contracts and sign new talent to compete at an elite level. However, many teams will not be using their amnesty this year for a few reasons:

They don’t understand how amnesty works. No one really does. Thus, they’re letting league officials tidy up the semantics and mechanics. This is a ridiculous, yet sadly valid reason.
Teams will fail to meet the minimum team salary if they expunge a hefty contract.
Teams want to wait for a better free agent market to spend their newly-freed salary.

## Shorter Max Contract Lengths

This is perhaps one of the more useful changes to the CBA. In the old CBA, max contracts were seven years. A lot can change in seven years. If you sign a player to $20 million/year for seven years, an injury can derail your franchise for nearly a decade. The revised CBA’s max contract length is five years. This gives teams less risk and more flexibility.

## Does the new CBA work?

Simply put, no. The players lost the fight. Many are not happy with the agreement, but needed to comply in order to start earning paychecks. Do you think that the players will decide to keep following this CBA after 2017? It is highly doubtful.

While some changes are designed to protect the small market teams, we still hear rumors that Chris Paul is going to be a Knick, Laker, or Celtic. Everyone, except for the diehard Magic fans, is convinced that Dwight Howard is searching for a house in Los Angeles after the 2012 season.

This new CBA is merely a bandage, not a cure. The system needs to be reformed. Teams need to have better methods to keep their franchise players. Owners need safeguards from overspending. Players need to be properly compensated.

All these factors coming together is like asking for a perfect storm. However, analyst Kenny Smith from TNT offered an [interesting solution](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN922wrLjv8) (at the 4:40 mark). To paraphrase, if the NBA’s BRI reaches a predetermined monetary goal, players get a bigger cut of the pie. However, if the NBA fails to reach that goal, players and owners split the pie evenly. Essentially, if players are able to make the league profitable, they get paid more. Simple, but it makes a lot of sense. And though it’s not a perfect system, a dynamic CBA may be something league officials should look into more closely.
