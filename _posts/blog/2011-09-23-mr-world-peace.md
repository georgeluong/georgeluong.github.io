On September 22nd, Mr. World Peace [parted ways](http://lakersblog.latimes.com/lakersblog/2011/09/metta-world-peace-donates-285000-to-charities.html?dlvrit=53297) with $285,000 with several mental health charities as the beneficiaries. This isn’t the first time that World Peace (an apt name, I think) has donated to these organizations. He [auctioned](http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=5597398) off his first (and only) championship ring and gave away to proceeds various groups. And on top of that, he has pledged “[all or some](http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/news/story?id=5901378)” of his 2011-2012 paycheck to help those in need. When asked about his decision, World Peace stated:

Sure, other players donate to charities and attend fundraisers as well. But I’m not sure we’ve seen a player embrace the act of giving on this scale. Obviously, mental health problems are something very personal to Metta. In a post-championship interview after defeating the Boston Celtics in 7 games, Metta (then Ron Artest) candidly attested to the support he received from counseling.

Metta is a great example of how things can turn around for a person, provided they get the help they need. If you don’t know to what I’m referring, watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjnFn3gQrts). I hate to bring it up again. However, it *is* part of who he was. But Metta World Peace is almost a complete 180° version from the Ron Artest of November 2004. In fact, Metta even went on to [win the 2010-2011 NBA Citizenship award](http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Ron-Artest-wins-2010-11-NBA-Citizenship-Award?urn=nba-wp2077). His story is truly one of redemption. If therapy and counseling has such a measurable, positive effect on Mr. World Peace’s life, I am very grateful that he’s willing to share that benefit with the less fortunate.

P.S. People are beginning to [take advantage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUC-GjJh8dY) of Ron-Ron’s kind heart and generosity. If they continue to produce such hilarious videos, I’m all for it. Sorry, Metta!
