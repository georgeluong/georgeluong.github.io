The Players Association and the team owners have met a few times, and these meetings have produced zero results. The NFL labor talks made great strides during its first few meetings, resolving its issues after 18 weeks. We’re approaching week 13 of the NBA lockout, and the only “news” we’ve heard is something along the lines of “another meeting has been scheduled.” Well, this prolonged impasse has forced the NBA to [postpone its training camps and cancel 43 preseason games](http://www.nba.com/2011/news/09/23/nba-cancels-43-preseason-games/).

This is an unfortunate step in the wrong direction. It looks like the likelihood of the season starting on time is almost 0% now. Now, we’re probably looking at a February start at best. Though, a shortened season is better than no season…
