As you may know, Yao Ming [announced his retirement](http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=6749511) earlier this summer, ending his nine season career in the NBA. Though [immensely talented and gifted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htm7b_saqcs), his body simply could not withstand the rigors of the needlessly long NBA season.

His potential to dominate the NBA was undermined by numerous injuries. Make no mistake, when healthy, Yao Ming [did dominate the opposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv47nwzmsvA). His imposing 7’6 frame, synergized with his unsurpassed work ethic, earned him the respect of his peers – most notably, [the respect of Shaquille O’Neal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjP0806a1Qg).

Perhaps six years from now, Yao’s application to the Hall of Fame as a player will be met with resistance. While Yao’s resumé doesn’t quite stack up to the illustrious careers of many Hall of Fame centers (Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, David Robinson), his admirable 19.0 PPG, 9.2 RPG, and 1.9 BPG does put him in range with some Hall of Fame centers, for example Bob Lanier (20.1 PPG, 10.1 RPG, and 1.5 BPG).

His main source of criticism will likely stem from his inability to carry his team deep into the post season, managing to get out of the first round only once in four attempts (Yao was injured during the Rockets’ 2008 Playoff campaign… when they also couldn’t get out of Round 1). His early playoff exits, of course, are the cause for the absence of rings on Yao’s massive hands. No championships indicate a more challenging road to [Springfield, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame).

However, Yao Ming does have an easier route mapped out to the Basketball Hall of Fame. This path turns a blind eye to the blemishes of an incomplete career. In fact, Yao could be enshrined before he is even eligible as a player, potentially entering the Hall as early as the summer of 2012. Retired players must wait five years before they can be considered for the exclusive club. Yao Ming could enter the Hall of Fame as a [contributor](http://www.hoophall.com/events/enshrinement/election-process/) to the sport.

Is there anyway to argue that Yao Ming doesn’t qualify as a contributor to basketball? Yao brought along 1.3 billion fans with him on his journey to the NBA. Even though he was injured, Yao was annually voted by fans to be a starter in All Star games. He opened up the (relatively) untapped Asian market to the NBA. He expanded the globalization framework that Michael Jordan began. And could we have asked for a better ambassador for the sport? Yao was modest, yet confident. He was funny, but never offensive. And let’s not forget [his philanthropic endeavors](http://www.theyaomingfoundation.org/). His enshrinement as a contributor is inevitable, but it won’t happen in 2012.

In an act of humility, Yao withdrew his name from consideration to the Hall of Fame.

Though there is no doubt in my mind about Yao’s status as a contributor, I believe his request was the right thing to do. Yao demonstrates his respect for the game and for those who came before him. It is something we’ve come to expect from Yao Ming; well spoken and tactful.

As for whether or not Yao deserves to be in the Hall of Fame based on his merits as a player, I believe he has earned the distinction. However, there are other great players still waiting for a phone call from the committee. Yao may have to wait his turn. But, for some reason, I don’t think he’ll mind.
